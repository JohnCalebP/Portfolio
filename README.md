# Portfolio
I'm Caleb, a Software QA Tester with experience in manual and automation testing. I started my career executing test cases, ensuring platform stability, and reporting defects. Wanting to expand my skills, I joined a freelance testing platform, collaborating with global teams on fast-paced projects.

Later, I gained structured experience in a professional testing environment, working on regression, smoke, exploratory, and automation testing using Playwright (JavaScript). I also handled test script maintenance and daily monitoring. In my recent role, I expanded my expertise in cross-browser testing with tools like BrowserStack and LambdaTest, working closely with developers and senior QAs.

This portfolio showcases my practical skills, learnings, and continuous growth. My current focus is enhancing both manual and automation testing to increase test coverage and improve my skills

# My Experience
My journey into software testing began with PressPlay Pioneer, where I worked as a Manual QA Tester. In this role, I executed test cases and explored various functionalities of a music streaming platform, ensuring it met the required standards. This initial experience sparked my interest in QA and motivated me to pursue further opportunities in the field.

I later joined uTest and Testlio, where I had the opportunity to collaborate with remote teams on a variety of projects, testing software applications in real-world scenarios. I worked on projects involving mobile and web platforms, where I was responsible for reporting bugs, testing new features, and assisting team leads with reproducing issues. These roles helped me refine my skills in teamwork and problem-solving while gaining hands-on experience in different testing environments.

At FilPass, I took on more responsibilities and learned how to contribute to both manual testing and automation testing efforts. Here, I collaborated with teams to verify system functionalities and improve the overall testing process. I also had the chance to test with various tools and frameworks, gaining further insight into the QA process.

In my most recent role at Travelshift, I tested new features and conducted regression and cross-browser testing, collaborating closely with developers and product managers. I continue to focus on improving test coverage and software quality by mastering both manual and automation testing techniques across various platforms.
