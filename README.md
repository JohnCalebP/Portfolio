# Portfolio
I'm Caleb, a Software QA Tester with experience in manual and automation testing. I started my career executing test cases, ensuring platform stability, and reporting defects. Wanting to expand my skills, I joined a freelance testing platform, collaborating with global teams on fast-paced projects.

Later, I gained structured experience in a professional testing environment, working on regression, smoke, exploratory, and automation testing using Playwright (JavaScript). I also handled test script maintenance and daily monitoring. In my recent role, I expanded my expertise in cross-browser testing with tools like BrowserStack and LambdaTest, working closely with developers and senior QAs.

This portfolio showcases my practical skills, learnings, and continuous growth. My current focus is enhancing both manual and automation testing to increase test coverage and improve my skills

# My Experience
I have extensive experience in manual and automated software testing, specializing in regression testing, exploratory testing, cross-browser testing, and API testing. My work at uTest, Testlio, Travelshift, and FilPass involved executing test cases, reporting bugs, and ensuring software functionality across various web and mobile applications.

At FilPass, I implemented test automation using Playwright (JavaScript), maintained test scripts via Bitbucket, and conducted end-to-end testing. In Travelshift, I performed cross-browser testing using BrowserStack and LambdaTest and validated UI/UX designs. My testing also involved network debugging with Charles Proxy, API validation using Postman, and test management through TestRail, Qase, and JIRA.

I continuously enhance my expertise in manual and automation testing to improve test coverage and software quality across diverse platforms
