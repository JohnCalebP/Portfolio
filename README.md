# Portfolio
I'm Caleb, a Software QA Tester with experience in manual and automation testing. I started my career executing test cases, ensuring platform stability, and reporting defects. Wanting to expand my skills, I joined a freelance testing platform, collaborating with global teams on fast-paced projects.

Later, I gained structured experience in a professional testing environment, working on regression, smoke, exploratory, and automation testing using Playwright (JavaScript). I also handled test script maintenance and daily monitoring. In my recent role, I expanded my expertise in cross-browser testing with tools like BrowserStack and LambdaTest, working closely with developers and senior QAs.

This portfolio showcases my practical skills, learnings, and continuous growth. My current focus is enhancing both manual and automation testing to increase test coverage and improve my skills
