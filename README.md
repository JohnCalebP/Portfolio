# Portfolio
I'm Caleb, a Software QA Tester with experience in manual and automation testing. I started my career executing test cases, ensuring platform stability, and reporting defects. Wanting to expand my skills, I joined a freelance testing platform, collaborating with global teams on fast-paced projects.

Later, I gained structured experience in a professional testing environment, working on regression, smoke, exploratory, and automation testing using Playwright (JavaScript). I also handled test script maintenance and daily monitoring. In my recent role, I expanded my expertise in cross-browser testing with tools like BrowserStack and LambdaTest, working closely with developers and senior QAs.

This portfolio showcases my practical skills, learnings, and continuous growth. My current focus is enhancing both manual and automation testing to increase test coverage and improve my skills

# My Experience
Starting with PressPlay Pioneer as a Manual QA Tester, I performed manual QA testing on a music streaming platform. This role marked the beginning of my career in software testing, where I executed over 400 test cases, focusing on test case execution and exploratory testing to ensure functionality and user experience.

Following that, I expanded my experience at uTest and Testlio, where I worked on manual and automated testing for a wide range of applications, including regression testing, cross-browser testing, and API validation. At FilPass, I gained expertise in automation testing using Playwright (JavaScript), where I developed and maintained test scripts, and at Travelshift, I performed cross-browser testing with BrowserStack and LambdaTest.

I continue to focus on improving test coverage and software quality by mastering both manual and automation testing techniques across various platforms.
